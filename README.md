#### This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game with AI capabilities using the Minimax algorithm. The project consists of five main files:


1. **game.py**: Describes the rules and mechanics of the Tic Tac Toe game.
2. **minimax.py**: Implements the Minimax algorithm to simulate playing against an AI opponent.
3. **simulation.py**: Generates data from random game simulations to train the AI model.
4. **model.py**: Trains the AI model using data generated by simulation.py and stored in tictactoe.csv.
5. **test.py**: Initializes the trained model for playing Tic Tac Toe against it.

## Requirements
  * Python 3.x
  * Required libraries specified in requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Set up the environment:
   ` pip install -r requirements.txt `

2. Generate game data:
   ` python simulation.py `
3. Train the model:
   ` python model.py `
4. Play the game against the AI:
   ` python test.py `

## Files
* **game.py**: Core game logic and rules.
* **minimax.py**: AI opponent logic using Minimax algorithm.
* **simulation.py**: Data generation for AI training.
* **model.py**: Model training script.
* **test.py**: Script for playing against the trained model.
* **tictactoe.csv**: Dataset generated from simulations.
* **tictactoe_model.h5**: Trained AI model.
